# Personal-Webpage
A webpage for me to display myself and my accomplishments

Created through the help of StackSkill's "Javascript Basics for Beginners" course.

Nothing in the website is my own work, all images, photos, and even the style of the page itself is created by others.
Eventually I'll replace it with my own stuff of course

either way, you can check it out right [here](https://thegouge.github.io)
