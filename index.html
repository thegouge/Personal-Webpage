                        Of the three skills listed here, this is the one I'm still
                        currently learning. But I'm learning quickly and putting a bunch of what I learn
                        into this website and the stuff it links to (try clicking the hero title up above)

                        The skill I have worked at for the longest time. 
                        I mostly specialize in post production sound mixing and sound editing, 
                        but I'm proficient in other departments as well!

                    <h4>Music Production</h4>
                    <p>
                        I was the music director of the UCSD Tritones for a year in College. And through that I
                        learned how to arrange a-cappella music. That not only bolstered my current love of music,
                        but also gave me an understanding of the skills necessary to execute it well

            <p id="about-text">
                I'm a young man who hailed from the magical land of Los Angeles, I moved up to Vancouver for a while (because of my dad),
                and now I'm looking to get back into Los Angeles to pursue my passions of film-making, video game production,
                coding, and not being unemployed! I'm an eager, young man looking to make a difference in this world
                and I'm still figuring out exactly how I'll do that. I have so many skills and interests, I don't know what to
                do with myself! The least of which are: Coding, Guitar, Drums, Video Games, Film-Making, Improv Comedy, Close-Up Magic,
                American Sign Language, and oh so many more. I'm a jack of many-a-trade with various degrees of proficiency. But I'm
                quick to learn. I love learning and picking things apart to find out how they work!
